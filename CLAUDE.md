# CLAUDE.md

Operational guide for working in this repo. For product/brand context see [README.md](README.md)
and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (canonical OPS Tech brand tokens).

## What this is

Orono Public Schools **Peer Evaluator Observations** app — a Firebase + React + TypeScript rebuild
of a Google Apps Script web app. Solo-developed; targeting an Aug/Sept 2026 cutover. Google SSO is
restricted to `@orono.k12.mn.us`.

## Monorepo layout (pnpm workspaces)

| Workspace           | Package          | Stack / role                                                         | Build              |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `apps/web`          | `@ops/web`       | Vite + React 19 + TS, Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui — evaluator & admin UIs | `vite build`       |
| `apps/functions`    | `@ops/functions` | Cloud Functions v2 (Node 22) — auth blocking, observation lifecycle  | `tsup` → `lib/`    |
| `apps/pdf-renderer` | —                | Cloud Run (Hono + Puppeteer) — PDF generation                        | —                  |
| `packages/shared`   | `@ops/shared`    | Workspace-internal Zod schemas, types, constants, brand tokens       | `tsc -b` → `dist/` |

Data is Cloud Firestore; blob storage is Google Drive (service account + Domain-Wide Delegation).

## Commands (run from repo root)

| Command                  | What it does                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`               | Vite dev server (`@ops/web`)                                        |
| `pnpm dev:emulators`     | Firestore + Auth + Functions + Storage emulators (imports fixtures) |
| `pnpm build`             | `pnpm -r build` — all workspaces                                    |
| `pnpm typecheck`         | `pnpm -r typecheck` — all workspaces                                |
| `pnpm lint`              | `eslint . --max-warnings 0` (strict; warnings fail)                 |
| `pnpm format` / `:check` | Prettier write / check                                              |
| `pnpm test`              | `pnpm -r test` — Vitest per workspace                               |
| `pnpm test:rules`        | Firestore security-rules tests (needs emulator — see gotchas)       |
| `pnpm test:e2e`          | Playwright E2E (desktop + iPad viewports)                           |
| `pnpm validate`          | **typecheck + lint + format:check + test** — the full gate          |

## Required workflow rules

- **Run the gate before every `git push`.** At minimum `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check`
  on what you changed (full `pnpm validate` when practical). CI failures from preventable
  typecheck/lint/format issues are not acceptable.
- **No suppressions.** ESLint runs `strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked` (type-checked rules).
  Do not introduce `any`, `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error`, `eslint-disable`, or skipped tests. Fix the
  underlying issue. Genuinely-needed config exceptions live in `eslint.config.js` with a comment.
- **Type imports are enforced:** `import type { … }` for types (`consistent-type-imports`).
- **Match existing style** — Prettier-formatted; follow the patterns in neighboring files.
- **Commit/push only when asked.** `dev-paul` is the working branch; `main` is production.

## Gotchas (these cause real failures)

- **Build `@ops/shared` before typechecking or running the web app.** Consumers import it from `dist/`,
  not source. After editing `packages/shared`: run `pnpm --filter @ops/shared build`, **and** if the Vite
  dev server is running, restart it (clear the `.vite` cache) so it picks up the new `dist`. The
  production `pnpm build` is unaffected (it rebuilds shared first via `pnpm -r`).
- **`@ops/functions` deploys from `apps/functions/lib`** (the `tsup` output), not from source. Firebase's
  function source is `apps/functions/lib` per `firebase.json`.
- **`pnpm test:rules` needs a working emulator.** On Windows it requires `TEMP`/`TMP` pointing at a short
  path (e.g. `C:/Temp`) **and Java 21** on `PATH`, or the Firestore emulator crashes on startup.
- **ESLint is type-aware**, so it needs each workspace's tsconfig to resolve. New source files must be
  covered by a `tsconfig` referenced in `eslint.config.js` `parserOptions.project`.
- **Windows line endings (`core.autocrlf=true`, no `.gitattributes`).** Git checks files out as CRLF
  locally but commits LF, so a _full-repo_ `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format:check` reports thousands of false
  `Delete ␍` / formatting warnings that CI (Linux, LF) never sees. Don't "fix" them — it fights autocrlf
  and creates a huge spurious diff. Verify your gate on **changed files only** (`pnpm exec prettier
--check <files>`, `pnpm exec eslint <files>` — Prettier writes them as LF), and trust `git status` /
  `git diff` over the full-repo formatter output.

## Deploy (GitHub Actions — do not run manual deploys)

- Push to **`dev-paul`** → auto-deploys a Hosting **preview** channel (against live Firestore).
- **`main`** → production deploy via a manual `workflow_dispatch` (approval-gated). Don't trigger it.
- CI runs on pushes to `main` and on PRs.

## Repeatable optimization workflow

`.claude/workflows/optimize-codebase.js` is a reusable [Workflow](.claude/workflows/optimize-codebase.js)
that audits the codebase across 5 dimensions, ranks findings by impact, and (in `mode:'full'`) implements
them in file-disjoint waves with verify-after-each-wave. Use `mode:'analyze'` for a read-only audit.
Git commits, push, CI/deploy monitoring, and the PR remain the orchestrator's responsibility — not the
workflow's.
